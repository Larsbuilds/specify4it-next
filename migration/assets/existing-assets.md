# Existing Assets Analysis

## Website Investigation Results

1. Overall Design
   - The website is extremely minimalist
   - Text-based design with minimal to no images
   - No visible logo beyond text
   - No visible icons or decorative elements
   - Clean, typography-focused layout

2. Asset Search Results
   - Attempted to access common asset paths:
     - `/favicon.ico` - Not found or inaccessible
     - `/images/logo.png` - Not found
     - `/assets/logo.svg` - Not found
     - `/styles.css` - Found but appears to be minimal

3. Current Implementation
   - Logo appears to be text-only using system fonts
   - Navigation is text-based without icons
   - Feature sections use text without icons
   - No background images or decorative elements found

## Recommendations

1. Maintain Minimalist Approach
   - Keep the clean, text-focused design
   - Use typography as the primary design element
   - Add subtle visual elements without overwhelming the content

2. Required New Assets
   - Create a simple, text-based logo that matches current branding
   - Design minimal icons for features (check, animate, deduce, prove)
   - Add subtle UI elements for better user experience
   - Create a basic favicon for browser recognition

3. Asset Creation Priority
   - High Priority:
     - Text-based logo in SVG format
     - Favicon
   - Medium Priority:
     - Feature icons
     - UI interaction elements
   - Low Priority:
     - Decorative elements
     - Background patterns/textures

4. Design Guidelines
   - Maintain current color scheme
   - Keep designs simple and understated
   - Focus on typography and whitespace
   - Use icons sparingly and only where they add value

## Next Steps
1. Create a simple text-based logo that matches current site
2. Design a basic favicon based on the logo
3. Implement minimal feature icons using Lucide React
4. Add subtle UI elements for improved interaction
5. Test all new assets in both light and dark modes
