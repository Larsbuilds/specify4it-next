## Implementation Order

1. Base Setup
   ```bash
   # Update Tailwind config with Specify4IT colors
   # Set up font configuration
   # Configure MDX processing
   ```

2. Layout Implementation
   ```tsx
   # app/layout.tsx - Base layout
   # app/components/header.tsx - Navigation
   # app/components/footer.tsx - Footer with logo
   ```

3. Component Migration
   ```tsx
   # Migrate existing components
   # Add animation components
   # Set up icon system
   ```

4. Page Implementation
   ```tsx
   # app/page.tsx - Home page
   # app/product/page.tsx - Product page
   # app/about/page.tsx - About page
   ```

5. Content Integration
   ```tsx
   # Add MDX content
   # Set up metadata
   # Configure navigation
   ```

6. Styling & Polish
   ```tsx
   # Apply Specify4IT theme
   # Add animations
   # Implement responsive design
   ```

## Implementation Notes

1. Existing Codebase
   - Use existing layout structure
   - Keep current component architecture
   - Only modify styling to match Specify4IT

2. New Features
   - SVG-to-GIF animations
   - Feature icons integration
   - Content layout system

3. Migration Strategy
   - Implement page by page
   - Test thoroughly after each major component
   - Maintain existing responsive behavior

4. Performance Considerations
   - Optimize images and animations
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Consider reduced-motion preferences

## Ready to Start ✅

Everything needed for migration is documented and organized:
1. Content structure is complete
2. Assets are organized
3. Components are mapped
4. Design system is documented
5. Technical requirements are met

Next step: Begin implementation with base setup and layout components.
