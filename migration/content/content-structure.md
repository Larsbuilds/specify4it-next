### Hero Section
```yaml
title: "Innovative technology. A powerful new software solution."
subtitle: "The Specify4IT automated reasoning toolset creates error free code from provable specifications."
description: "Specify4IT™ is an innovative product conceived, designed and built specifically for developers who want to create relational database software right first time."
```

### About the Toolset
```yaml
sections:
  - title: "Structure your software"
    content: "This automated toolset enables a user to specify software in a structured way, resulting in provable specifications that can be checked and animated prior to generating any code. As the specifications are created mathematically using axiomatic reasoning, the subsequent code generation can be done automatically in minutes."

  - title: "Efficient workflow"
    content: "The result of this is error-free code, created at the click of a button; estimated to take half the time and with half the workforce of conventional methods."

  - title: "Creating a new method"
    content: "This impressive technology has been developed by leading technology expert John Warren, whose work over 35 years has created a new method called \"provable specification\"."
```

### Why Specify4IT Section
```yaml
main_content: "Creating \"right first time\" software for large modern programs is almost impossible, and users are continually frustrated by needing to install patches and updates. This is not an easy issue to solve as modern programs and programming languages are often too complex to be fully understood and checked by individual programmers. Often clients cannot specify their needs clearly, precisely, and unambiguously, making it difficult for the programmer to create code without errors."

solution: "Specify4IT creates error free database systems faster, mathematically provable, in exact accordance with the required specifications."

```

### Solution Section
```yaml
title: "A new solution"
content: "During his career, John became increasingly frustrated at the lack of rigour associated with specifying database systems and the resulting error prone software. In 1984, he founded Precision Design Technology Ltd, and alongside running his consultancy, he has spent 35 years developing, proving, and implementing a new method of software specification, namely an original theory of provable software and an implementation toolset."
result: "The result: software programmers can create proven and correct software, without the need for an advanced understanding of maths and logic. A major advance in software engineering."
