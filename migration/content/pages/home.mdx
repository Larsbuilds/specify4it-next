## About the Toolset

### Structure your software
This automated toolset enables a user to specify software in a structured way, resulting in provable specifications that can be checked and animated prior to generating any code. As the specifications are created mathematically using axiomatic reasoning, the subsequent code generation can be done automatically in minutes.

### Efficient workflow
The result of this is error-free code, created at the click of a button; estimated to take half the time and with half the workforce of conventional methods.

### Creating a new method
This impressive technology has been developed by leading technology expert John Warren, whose work over 35 years has created a new method called "provable specification".

## Why Specify4IT

Creating "right first time" software for large modern programs is almost impossible, and users are continually frustrated by needing to install patches and updates. This is not an easy issue to solve as modern programs and programming languages are often too complex to be fully understood and checked by individual programmers. Often clients cannot specify their needs clearly, precisely, and unambiguously, making it difficult for the programmer to create code without errors.

Specify4IT creates error free database systems faster, mathematically provable, in exact accordance with the required specifications.

### Features
- **Check**: there are no conflicts
- **Animate**: user behaviour specification
- **Deduce**: the customer requirements
- **Prove**: the application properties

## Our Background

### A dedicated career
John Warren has spent his 50-year career dedicated to software engineering and specification, resulting in him leading a successful consultancy, delivering projects to clients such as British Airports Authority, British Gas, UK Department of Health, UK Department of Trade and Industry, London Stock Exchange, National Grid PLC, Nuclear Electric PLC, UK Ministry of Defence, and Rio Tinto PLC.
